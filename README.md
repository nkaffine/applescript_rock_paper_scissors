# applescript_rock_paper_scissors

This applescript is designed using the built in voice command tools in applescript to interact with a spreadsheet in numbers.
The applescript logs the outcome of every game of rock paper scissors and creates statistics on the likelihood that someone
will choose rock, paper, or scissors based on previous throws.
